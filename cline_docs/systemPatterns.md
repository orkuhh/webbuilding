# System Architecture Patterns

## Frontend Structure
- Component-based architecture
- Atomic design principles:
  * Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
  * Molecules: Combined UI elements (forms)
  * Organisms: Complex components (build editor)
  * Templates: Page layouts
  * Pages: Complete views

## State Management
- React Context API for:
  * Current build state
  * User authentication
  * Theme preferences
- Local storage for:
  * Saved builds
  * User preferences

## Routing
- React Router for:
  * Build creation
  * Build viewing
  * User profiles
  * Search results

## API Integration
- RESTful API design for:
  * Build CRUD operations
  * User authentication
  * Build search and filtering
